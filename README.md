üìå Project Description:
 This project implements both autonomous and manual navigation for a TurtleBot3 robot in the Webots simulation environment. The robot navigates through predefined target points while avoiding obstacles using various sensors including LiDAR, GPS, compass, and a camera. It also supports logging functionality for 3D mapping using LiDAR point clouds and path tracking.

 
üéØ Project Objectives :
‚Ä¢	Enable autonomous obstacle avoidance and target navigation using real-time sensor data.
‚Ä¢	Implement manual override control via keyboard inputs.
‚Ä¢	Integrate LiDAR-based dynamic obstacle detection and camera-based environmental perception.
‚Ä¢	Log robot paths and 3D point cloud data for mapping and analysis.


üß† Algorithm & Model Development Autopilot Mode:
‚Ä¢	Calculates the robot‚Äôs orientation and distance to the target. Adjusts wheel speeds using a Braitenberg-like reactive system for real-time obstacle avoidance.
‚Ä¢	Obstacle Avoidance: Employs Gaussian-weighted influence derived from LiDAR data to steer the robot away from nearby obstacles.
‚Ä¢	Manual Mode: Allows keyboard-controlled navigation for free exploration.
‚Ä¢	Path Logging: Logs GPS coordinates and LiDAR point cloud data into .csv files for analysis.
‚Ä¢	Camera Analysis: Periodic RGB sampling from the center of the image to gather environmental context.


üß© Hardware Requirements GPS and Compass Modules
‚Ä¢	LiDAR Sensor
‚Ä¢	Raspberry Pi or OpenCR Board

üõ†Ô∏è Software Tools Webots: 3D simulation and robot control
‚Ä¢	C Programming Language: Controller logic implementation
‚Ä¢	GNU Compiler (GCC): For compiling the control code
‚Ä¢	CSV Logging: For storing point cloud and path data
