üìå Project Description
This project implements both autonomous and manual navigation for a TurtleBot3 robot in the Webots simulation environment. The robot navigates through predefined target points while avoiding obstacles using various sensors including LiDAR, GPS, compass, and a camera. It also supports logging functionality for 3D mapping using LiDAR point clouds and path tracking.

üéØ Project Objectives
Enable autonomous obstacle avoidance and target navigation using real-time sensor data.

Implement manual override control via keyboard inputs.

Integrate LiDAR-based dynamic obstacle detection and camera-based environmental perception.

Log robot paths and 3D point cloud data for mapping and analysis.

üß† Algorithm & Model Development
Autopilot Mode:
Calculates the robot‚Äôs orientation and distance to the target. Adjusts wheel speeds using a Braitenberg-like reactive system for real-time obstacle avoidance.

Obstacle Avoidance:
Employs Gaussian-weighted influence derived from LiDAR data to steer the robot away from nearby obstacles.

Manual Mode:
Allows keyboard-controlled navigation for free exploration.

Path Logging:
Logs GPS coordinates and LiDAR point cloud data into .csv files for analysis.

Camera Analysis:
Periodic RGB sampling from the center of the image to gather environmental context.

üß© Hardware Requirements
GPS and Compass Modules

LiDAR Sensor

Raspberry Pi or OpenCR Board

üõ†Ô∏è Software Tools
Webots: 3D simulation and robot control

C Programming Language: Controller logic implementation

GNU Compiler (GCC): For compiling the control code

CSV Logging: For storing point cloud and path data
